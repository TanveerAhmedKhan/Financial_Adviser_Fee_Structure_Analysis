# Financial Adviser Fee Structure Analysis

## Overview

This analysis examines the fee structures of financial advisers based on data extracted from regulatory filings (Form ADV Part 2). The dataset contains 1,734 records from different advisers, with information about their fee structures, minimum investment requirements, and negotiability of fees.

## Key Findings

### Fee Structure Types

- **Tiered Fee Structures**: 1,035 advisers (59.7%)
- **Flat Fee Structures**: 191 advisers (11.0%)
- **No Fee Information**: 508 advisers (29.3%)

Tiered fee structures, where the fee percentage decreases as assets under management (AUM) increase, are the most common approach used by financial advisers.

### Fee Percentages by Tier

| Tier | Average Fee | Median Fee | Min Fee | Max Fee |
|------|-------------|------------|---------|---------|
| Tier 1 | 1.22% | 1.00% | 0.00% | 3.00% |
| Tier 2 | 1.02% | 0.80% | 0.00% | 2.50% |
| Tier 3 | 0.86% | 0.70% | 0.00% | 2.00% |
| Tier 4 | 0.82% | 0.75% | 0.00% | 4.00% |
| Tier 5 | 0.83% | 0.65% | 0.05% | 10.00% |
| Tier 6 | 0.92% | 0.60% | 0.00% | 30.00% |
| Tier 7 | 0.68% | 0.60% | 0.00% | 2.00% |
| Tier 8 | 0.74% | 0.60% | 0.00% | 5.00% |

The data shows a clear pattern of decreasing fee percentages as AUM increases, with the first tier having the highest average fee (1.22%) and subsequent tiers generally having lower fees.

### Negotiable Fees

- **Negotiable**: 1,077 advisers (89.4%)
- **Non-negotiable**: 127 advisers (10.6%)

The vast majority of advisers offer negotiable fees, indicating flexibility in their fee structures.

### Minimum Investment Requirements

- **Average Minimum Investment**: $1,985,895.28
- **Median Minimum Investment**: $100,000.00

The large difference between the average and median minimum investment suggests that there are some advisers with very high minimum requirements that skew the average upward.

### Multiple Products

939 advisers (54.2%) potentially offer multiple products with different fee structures. This is identified by looking for multiple fee tiers that start at low AUM values (e.g., $0 or close to it).

Example of an adviser with multiple products:
```
Adviser ID: 10046
  Annual fee threshold 1: $0 - $10,000,000 (0.60%) [VERIFIED]
  Annual fee Threshold 2: $10,000,001+ (0.50%) [VERIFIED]
  Annual fee Threshold 3: $0 - $10,000,000 (0.90%) [VERIFIED]
  Annual fee Threshold 4: $10,000,001 - $15,000,000 (0.80%) [VERIFIED]
  Annual fee Threshold 5: $15,000,001 - $20,000,000 (0.60%) [VERIFIED]
  Annual fee Threshold 6: $20,000,001+ (0.50%) [VERIFIED]
  Annual fee Threshold 7: $0+ (1.00%) [VERIFIED]
```

This adviser appears to have at least three different products, each with its own fee structure starting at $0.

## Visualizations

The following visualizations were generated to help understand the data:

1. **Fee Structure Types**: Distribution of flat fee vs. tiered fee structures
2. **Negotiable Fees**: Proportion of advisers offering negotiable fees
3. **Minimum Investment**: Distribution of minimum investment requirements
4. **Fee Percentages by Tier**: Box plots showing the distribution of fee percentages for each tier
5. **Fee Trends Over Time**: Changes in average fee percentages over time

## Data Irregularities and Challenges

Several challenges were encountered during the analysis:

1. **Inconsistent Formatting**: The fee thresholds and percentages were not consistently formatted, making extraction difficult.
2. **Misplaced Information**: In some cases, ChatGPT placed fee information in incorrect columns.
3. **Multiple Products**: Many advisers have multiple products with different fee structures, which complicates the analysis.
4. **Missing Data**: About 29% of records had no fee information available.

## Recommendations for Further Analysis

1. **Product Classification**: Develop a more sophisticated algorithm to identify and classify different products offered by advisers.
2. **Competitive Analysis**: Compare fee structures across advisers to identify competitive positioning.
3. **Temporal Analysis**: Analyze how fee structures have changed over time for the same adviser.
4. **Correlation Analysis**: Investigate relationships between fee structures and other adviser characteristics.
5. **Market Segmentation**: Identify different market segments based on fee structures and minimum investment requirements.

## Conclusion

The analysis reveals that tiered fee structures are the most common approach used by financial advisers, with fees generally decreasing as AUM increases. Most advisers offer negotiable fees, and many have multiple products with different fee structures. The median minimum investment requirement is $100,000, but there is significant variation across advisers.

This analysis provides valuable insights into the fee structures of financial advisers, which can be used for benchmarking, competitive analysis, and market segmentation.
